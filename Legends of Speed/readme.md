in the farm codes, if you wonder why this line
```lua
                    for i = 1, 100 do
```
is for, its so that it runs the remote event 100 times each repetition, making it way stronger/faster, to make it even more faster, give the second number a higher value
like this!

```lua
                    for i = 1, 500 do
```
Obviously, making it higher can lead into making your game laggy, so make sure its not too high! (500 is really really high btw)
